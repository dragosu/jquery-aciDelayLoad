aciDelayLoad - Delayed image loading with jQuery

With this plugin you can enable delayed load of images in your pages. What it
does is check to see if the images are in the visible area and then load them
(by pointing the 'src' attribute to the real image URL). The check is done when
you scroll the content or resize the browser window. It's also possible to
trigger an 'update' event to load the images in view (if added/replaced
dynamically for example) so it should work just fine with any image gallery
or slider.

Simple usage:

$().ready(function(){

    $(document).aciDelayLoad();

});

Note: You must not use this plugin on the 'window' object, instead use it on
the 'document', it will bind 'onresize' event to also load images when the
browser window is resized.

If you change the content with JavaScript (Ajax) then you simply need
to trigger the 'update' event, like this:

$(document).trigger('update');

Have one or more image galleries that supports scrolling in the same page?
Just add the delayed load on the container who is scrolling, like:

$().ready(function(){

    $('#gallery1,#gallery2').aciDelayLoad();

});

and trigger the 'update' event (when/if required), like:

$('#gallery1,#gallery2').trigger('update');
